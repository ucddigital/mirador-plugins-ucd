Plugins for the Mirador IIIF-compliant image viewer

## IIIF-imageManipulation
Stand-alone implementation of UCD's IIIF image re-formatting tool + plugin to integrate with Mirador IIIF-compliant image viewer.

To add to your project, install index.html in a directory with the sub-directories js and img. Once installed, usage syntax is:

```
/dirname/index.html?imageID={IIIF_image_id}
```
where IIIF_image_id is the image resource identifier from a IIIF manifest (the identifier presented to a IIIF Image API server). For example:
```
/dirname/index.html?imageID=https://iiif.ucd.ie/loris/ivrla:3858
```
To integrate with Mirador, install the plugin file ```imageCropper_plugin.js``` and in Mirador startup file, add to windowSettings: "imageManip": true. In the Mirador startup file, also add the following line after the script reference to ```mirador.js```:

```<script src="/<your_plugin_path>/imageCropper_plugin.js"></script>```
